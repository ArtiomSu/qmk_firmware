This is a custom built 30% or 30 key keybaord. The case is made with a 3d pen (not printer) so its very cheap to build it. The most expensive part of this keyboard are the switches themselves. To make this usable it relies on alot of qmk features like combos, leader key and ofcource different keymap layouts.

# Parts Used
1. 1x arduino pro micro
2. 30x box navy and cherry mx blue switches ( cause I ran out of box navys )
3. 30x small diodes
4. random wires
5. solder + soldering iron
6. 3d pen and fillament for the case
7. printer to print out the blueprints
8. Some switch to use for the Arduino reset pins. I used a salvaged switch from a cheap old mouse.

# Build Guide
I printed off a simple layout I created in freecad and stuck it to the table so its easy to trace over with the 3d pen.

This is the result of going over the layout roughtly 3 times with the 3d pen.

This is how it looks like from the back, this will be the side The switches will go on as it is very flat.

I decided to incorporate a wrist wrest at this point so I just extended the base.

This is again how it looks like from the back, or the front in this case as its the side on which the switches will be going on.

Next I forced all the switches in. This took a long time as some of the holes were too small so I had to melt them down a bit with my soldering iron.
![photo7](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/7.jpg)
This is how the switches look from the front, Ideally it would all be box navys but I ran out..

This is how it looks like with keycaps on.

Next I wanted to give the case a mid profile, so that the switches dont stick out as much. So I used a ruler to give the keycaps some extra space. And I will add material just infront of the ruler.
![photo11](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/11.jpg)
Here is a shot from the back, The ruler acts like a wall that I can just dump the filament onto.

This is how the raised edge looks like. Only the back and front is done here.
![photo13](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/13.jpg)
Here is a closer look. I left some space at the very edge so that the ruler is able to easily stay in place.

Another view from the other side.

This is after joining the corners.

Joining the corners on the other side.

Propped it up on another wrist wrest to see how it would look like. At this point I decided to incorporate this 20ish degree angle into the keyboard perminantly.
![photo18](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/18.jpg)
While the keyboard lays on the wrist wrest I filled in the sides with my 3d pen.

Now it is standing on its own. Still need to do the back.

The back is done by making a seperate rectangle seen in the nect photo and attaching it.
![photo22](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/22.jpg)
This peice is almost as long as the whole keyboard but left some space to join the corners easily
![photo23](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/23.jpg)
Corners are joined and filled in.

Looking for a good stop to place the arduino. Went with another spot later on as the cable would have been sticking out of the side.
![photo26](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/26.jpg)
Next is the electronics. So started wiring up the diodes on each switch.
![photo27](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/27.jpg)
Top row diodes wired up.
![photo28](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/28.jpg)
The diodes on the rest of the rows are wired up now.
![photo29](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/29.jpg)
Closer look.
![photo30](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/30.jpg)
Add tape on all rows to prevent short circuits with the next layer.
![photo31](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/31.jpg)
Soldering the columns together.
![photo32](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/32.jpg)
Add tape once again to prevent shorting anything else added on top.
![photo33](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/33.jpg)
Wiring up the rows and half of the columns to the arduino.

Wiring up the rest of the columns.

After melting a hole for the arduinos usb with a soldering iron I hot glue it in place.
![photo36](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/36.jpg)
This is how the hole looks like from the front.
![photo37](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/37.jpg)
Next I wire in a switch from an old mouse to act as the reset switch from the arduino.
![photo38](https://github.com/ArtiomSu/qmk_firmware/raw/artiomsu_tiny30/keyboards/artiomsu_tiny30/photos/38.jpg)
I add tape to the connectors on the arduino as the last few touch the table.
